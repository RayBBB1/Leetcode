## 1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element

### 1. Repeat
- Input
	- nums: binary array 
- Process: you should delete one element form it
- Output
	- return the **size** of the longest non-empty subarray containing **only 1's** in the resulting array
	- return  0 if there is no such subarray

> **Q1:  Am I required to delete an element? Or can I choose not to delete any element?**
> **A1: Yes, you must delete exactly one element.**  You cannot choose to keep the array as is.

### 2. Example
nums: [1,1,1]
Return: 2, you must delete one element

nums:[1,1,0,1,1]
Return: 4, after delete nums[2], nums = [1,1,1,1]

### 3. Approach
1. **Initialization:** Initialize a sliding window with `left = 0` and `right = 0`.  Also, initialize a variable `zeroNum= 0` to track the number of zeros within the current window, and `maxSize = 0` to store the maximum length found so far.

2. **Expand the Window:** Move the `right` pointer to the right, one position at a time.
   - If `nums[right]` is 0, increment `zeroNum`.

3. **Shrink the Window (if needed):**
   - While `zeroNum` is greater than 1 (meaning we have more than one zero in the current window), we need to shrink the window from the left.
     - If `nums[left]` is 0, decrement `zeroNum`.
     - Move the `left` pointer to the right by one position.

4. **Update Maximum Length:** After each expansion and potential shrinking of the window, calculate the current window's length.

### 4. Coding
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int zeroNum = 0;
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        int maxSize = 0;

        while(r < nums.size()){
            if (nums[r] == 0) zeroNum++;
            r++;        
            while(l < nums.size() && zeroNum > 1){
                if(nums[l] == 0)zeroNum--;
                l++;
            }

            maxSize = max(maxSize,r-l-1);
        }
        return maxSize;
    }

    /*
    test:
        intput: [1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1]

        r = 0 --> zeroNum = 0, r = 1
        r = 1 --> zeroNum = 0, r = 2
        r = 2 --> zeroNum = 1, r = 3
        r = 3 --> zeroNum = 2, r = 4
            l = 0 --> zeroNum = 2, l = 1
            ...
            l = 2 --> zeroNum = 1, l = 3


    */
};
```
