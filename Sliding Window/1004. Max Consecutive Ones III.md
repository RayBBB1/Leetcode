## **1004. Max Consecutive Ones III**
```
This problem asks us to find the length of the longest subarray containing only 1s after flipping at most `k` zeros.
We can use the **sliding window technique** to solve this problem efficiently.
The key challenge here is handling the **dynamic length** of the window as we need to consider the allowed flips.
```
### **1. Repeat**
- input
	- nums: binary arr
	- k: 
- output
	- The maximum length of a contiguous subarray containing only 1s after flipping at most `k` zeros in the original array.
 - 
### **2. Example**
```
    Let's consider the input `nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]` and `k = 2`.

    We are allowed to flip at most 2 zeros. By flipping two zeros (the zeros at index 3 and 4, or index 3 and 5, etc.) to ones, we can achieve a maximum consecutive subarray of 1s.

    For example, if we flip the zeros at index 3 and 4:
    `nums` becomes `[1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0]`

    The longest consecutive subarray of 1s is `[1,1,1,1,1,1]` with length 6 (from index 0 to 5).

    Therefore, the output should be 6.
```

### **3. Approach**
- The window size is dynamic. How do we use the sliding window strategy?
- We need to maintain a dynamically sized window
- Fortunately, there's a rule for the window size. We can maintain a window size that represents the current maximum number of consecutive 1s.
- how sholud we  move l and r pointer?

### **4. Coding**
Time: O(n), 100%
Space: O(1), 91.65%
```c++
	class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        int flipNum = 0;
        int maxSize = 0;

        while(r < nums.size()){
            if(nums[r] == 0){
                flipNum++;
            }
            r++;
            while(l < nums.size() && flipNum > k){
                if(nums[l] == 0) flipNum--;
                l++;
            }

            maxSize = max(maxSize,r-l);
        }
        return maxSize;
        
    }
};
	```
