# 1732. Find the Highest Altitude
## 1. Repeat
- Input: 
	- gain: int arr of length n
	- gain[i]: the net gain in altitude between points i and i+1
- Output:
	- the highest altitude of a point
- Process:
	- Calculate the altitude at each point and then find the maximum altitude
	- the given array gain reoresents the net "gain" in altitude
	
## 2. Example
gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]

the altitude at each point = [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]
return 1

## 3. Approach
- The altitude at each point can be calculated cumulatively. The initial altitude is 0. The altitude at point *i* (where *i* > 0) is the sum of the altitude at point *i*-1 and `gain[i-1]`.
- We can use prefix sum technology to simplify the problem.
- We can iteratively calculate the altitude. For each point *i* (starting from point 1), the altitude is updated by adding `gain[i-1]` to the altitude of the previous point.
- We can determine the highest altitude while calculating the altitudes.
	- Time Complexity: O(n) 100%
	- Space Complexity: O(1) 71.15%
		- Explanation: We do not need to store the entire altitude array. We only need to keep track of the current altitude and the maximum altitude encountered so far.le prefix sum table in this case

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int largestAltitude(vector<int>& gain) {
        int latestAltitude = 0;
        int highest = 0;
        for(auto num : gain){
            latestAltitude += num;
            highest = max(highest,latestAltitude);
        }
        return highest;
    }
};
```
